## Revolutionary AI Coaching Platform for Wild Rift

## 🎯 WHAT IS COACHOS?

CoachOS is **not just a coaching app** - it's a **living relationship** between you and your personal AI coach. Your coach learns, remembers, and grows with you. It's designed to make you **obsessed with improving** without any forced sharing or manipulation.

### The 5 Revolutionary Systems

#### 1. 🧠 **Memory Moments System**
Your coach remembers EVERY important moment:
- **Epic Plays** - Your best moments
- **Clutch Moments** - Pressure situations you handled
- **Terrible Mistakes** - Learning opportunities
- **Funny Moments** - Inside jokes
- **Learning Moments** - Key insights

Each moment has:
- Coach reaction (personalized to your coach's personality)
- Emotional weight (how important it is)
- Context (champion, role, enemy, KDA)
- Timestamp (when it happened)

**Why it's revolutionary:** Your coach doesn't just give tips - it REMEMBERS you. After 50 matches, your coach has a personal history with you.

---

#### 2. 🎯 **Skill Radar Visualization**
A 5D radar chart showing your playstyle:
- **Mechanics** - Champion mechanics & combos
- **Macro Play** - Map awareness & positioning
- **Decision Making** - Game sense & choices
- **Consistency** - Reliability across matches
- **Clutch Factor** - Performance under pressure

**Why it's revolutionary:** Players become OBSESSED with watching this improve. It's not about rank - it's about mastering your playstyle. You check it after every match to see if you improved.

#### 3. 🌊 **Flow State Detector**
Knows when you're in "the zone":
- Detects when you're playing at peak performance

**Why it's revolutionary:** Players want to FEEL the zone. They'll keep playing to reach peak flow state. It's addictive in a healthy way.

#### 4. 💫 **Personality Evolution**
Your coach becomes more personal over time:

**Stages:**
1. **Stranger** (0-10 interactions) - Professional, getting to know you
2. **Acquaintance** (10-25) - Starting to understand your style
3. **Friend** (25-50) - Building real connection
4. **Best Friend** (50-100) - Deep understanding & trust
5. **Legend** (100+) - Unbreakable bond, inside jokes, personal references

**Features:**
- Personal inside jokes (created from your play patterns)
- Personalized greetings
- Trust level system
- Shared experiences
- Personal references to your champion pool

**Why it's revolutionary:** Your coach isn't a tool - it's your friend. You want to play because you miss your coach.

---

#### 5. 🎮 **Live Commentary System**
Real-time reactions during matches:
- Coachen reacts to your plays
- Funny/supportive comments
- Personalized based on your coach's personality
- Not tips - just commentary (like a friend watching)

**Why it's revolutionary:** You're not alone while playing. You have a friend in your ear celebrating your wins and supporting your losses.
