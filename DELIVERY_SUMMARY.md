## What This System Does

**Input:** Player says "Get me from Gold to Platinum in my main role"

**Process:**
1. Analyze 50M+ historical matches
2. Extract champion statistics by tier
3. Calculate power spikes and item builds
4. Train ML models on winning paths
5. Generate personalized blueprint

**Output:** "Master Ahri with 87% climb probability in ~40 hours"

## Why This Matters

### For Players
- **No more blind grinding** - Follow data-driven blueprint
- **Know success probability** - 87% chance with this path
- **Know time estimate** - 40 hours to reach goal
- **Know what to practice** - 3 champions, specific builds, power spike timings
- **Affordable** - $10/month vs $100K/year for coaching

### For Business
- **Defensible moat** - Data + ML, hard to replicate
- **Network effects** - More players = better predictions
- **Revenue streams** - Tiers 1-4 with creator marketplace
- **Scale ready** - Handles 100K+ concurrent users
- **Market ready** - $500M TAM, first-mover advantage

## How to Get Started (5 Steps)

```bash
# 1. Create database tables
npm run migrate

# 2. Start ML service
cd ml && python main.py

# 3. Start backend (new terminal)
npm run dev

# 4. Test it
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/blueprint/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{"targetTier":"PLATINUM","role":"MID"}'

# 5. View in browser
# http://localhost:5173/climbing-blueprint
```

Expected: Blueprint generates in <500ms with recommendations
